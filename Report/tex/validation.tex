\chapter{Validation}
This chapter describes the model validation by playing back the use cases through sequence diagrams.
\section{Use Case Realization}
%Show how the system realizes the use cases selected in Sect. 4 using interaction diagrams. Show that each of the scenarios defined by the use cases is executed using the design of the system by providing sequence- or communication diagrams for each scenario. Choose the appropriate type of interaction diagram for a scenario.
We've performed the use case realization using sequence diagrams depicting the required interaction between system components.
\subsection{Cashier launching a toll cash lane}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:launches_a_toll_cash_lane} depicts the system view of performing Use Case 7 - Cashier launching a toll cash lane. Credentials need to be input via the touch screen, but are not defined further. This could be implemented as a simple button with the label ``login cashier'', but is abstracted away from in the system design. Credentials can, as part of the design be rejected or accepted to be able to implement more sophisticated authentication mechanism at a later time.

\subsection{Toll Tag purchase}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:customer_orders_toll_tag_online} depicts the system view of performing Use Case 6 - Toll Tag purchase. We provide an interface for placing a checkout order by the webserver that can be used by a web application. Whenever this is called, it is forwarded to the Toll Enterprise server, that will check the validity of the credit card credentials via the bank. If this step succeeds, a subscription is created. The subscription is propagated to every station in the enterprise to reduce the latency of toll tag check-in, as per design decision discussed in section \ref{sec:TODO:subscription}.
%TODO make reference to design section about why we propagate the information.

\subsection{Customer check-in single ticket}
The realization in figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:customer_check_in_single_ticket} covers four use cases; Use Case 1, 2, 4 and 8. It depicts ``happy path'' with the single exception of ticket validation, which needs to be performed at checkout. If the ticket is not valid or read correctly, the barrier will simply remain down, and a cashier needs to manually resolve the situation.
It is assumed that tickets are non-reusable, meaning that once a ticket has been inserted into the reader at the check out, it is not given back to the customer. This prevents situations in which it can be attempted to use a ticket multiple times at a check out.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Customer check-in toll tag}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:customer_check_in_toll_tag} depicts a scenario where a customer with an existing toll tag checks into the system. Check-out mirrors check-in and is, thus, not depicted. It realizes Use Case 3 and 5.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Enterprise manager changes toll rates}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:enterprise_manager_changes_toll_rates} depicts a manager actor operating the management client, changing the toll rates. The key matter to be aware of here is that a toll rate change must be applied consistently to all stations in the enterprise, per requirement \textbf{RQ27} (section \ref{sec:requirements}). It realizes Use Case 13.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Station manager generate report}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:station_manager_generate_report} depicts the scenario where a station manager generates a station report. It will contact the cash registers of every toll lane and retrieve the tickets sold, check-ins and check-outs. The actual report format is implementation specific and can be easily constructed using the information returned to station client. It realizes Use Case 11.

  \caption{Sequence diagram of the scenario where an toll station manager generates report}
  \label{fig:seq_diag:station_manager_generate_report}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Enterprise manager generates report}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:station_manager_generate_report} depicts the scenario where an enterprise manager generates an enterprise report. To perform this, the functionality from station report generation is reused (see \ref{fig:seq_diag:station_manager_generate_report}) and subsequently a merge (or possibly a summary - implementation specific) of all the reports from the stations is made. It realizes Use Case 15.

  \caption{Sequence diagram of the scenario where an enterprise manager generates report}
  \label{fig:seq_diag:enterprise_manager_generate_report}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Notify customers}
Figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:notify_customers} depict the scenario where an enterprise manager has to notify customers of -- for instance -- pricing updates. The interface is defined on the enterprise server, but is left as implementation-specific for the actual delivery, as this needs to be (for regular mail) mapped to manual business process.

  \caption{Sequence diagram of the scenario where an enterprise manager generates report}
  \label{fig:seq_diag:notify_customers}
\end{figure}

\subsection{System charges customers}
While not mapped to a use case, we have identified ``System charges customers'' (figure \ref{fig:seq_diag:system_charges_customers}) as a requirement. The system periodically charges the toll tag customers, exploiting the previously defined interface for harvesting reports. This is because reports contain check-ins, check-outs and number of tickets sold -- which is the information needed.\\\\
The propagation of cancel() to station servers is intentionally left out to reduce diagram congestion and size.

\subsection{Remaining use cases}
The use cases 9, 10 and 12 are considered too trivial to perform use case realization on.
