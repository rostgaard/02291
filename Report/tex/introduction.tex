\chapter{Introduction}
%From PD. Keep in mind while writing.
%The introduction should describe the steps actually used to solve the modelling task and why these stepswere chosen. For example, were techniques from agile modelling used (which?), were CRC cards used,domain-driven design, explorative modelling, etc.?
\noindent
This document contains the modeling of a toll system which could be used on any highway road. The system needs to implemented in toll stations which are placed at the entrance and exit point of the highway. Customers can use the highway by purchasing a single ticket which is at fixed price at the entrance or by using a toll tag which could be bought via the system online. The customer have the option to purchase the ticket by cash or by credit card at the toll stations. In order to identify the toll tag there are wireless sensors which are installed on the toll station to read the toll tag on a vehicle. Once the toll tag is read by the sensor, the system will authenticate the vehicle, then the barrier at the toll station will open allowing the user to use the highway. The authentication of the vehicle takes place at both entrance and the exit toll stations. Station managers can query statistical data from the system which can give the manager an overview of the system usage. Another additional feature of the system is that it enables enterprise manager to send email or mail notification to customers about prices changes.
