\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Experience with the project}
%This section should cotain the experiences with the project. For example, what was learned, what are the things you can improve next time, and what you did make good this time. (This will not be graded!)
Taking this course has been, roughly equivalent, of banging my little toe against a large -- and very solid -- credenza. The pain is excruciating, and the one question that runs through my mind is ``why?!''. -- Grade that!
